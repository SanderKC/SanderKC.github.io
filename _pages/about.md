Hi, my name is Sander K. christensen. I am a mechanical engineer witj a bachelor's degreee from Aarhus University (Januar 2024). My passion lies in the intersection of mechatronics, robotics, design, and manufacturing — especially where ideas can move quickly from concept to prototype.

I thrive in environments where hands-on problem solving and iteration are key. Whether it's refining a mechanism through rapid prototyping or fine-tuning a design for production, I enjoy turning ideas into tangible, working solutions.  

Outside my academic work, I’m a dedicated maker. I spend my time experimenting across a wide range of disciplines — from woodworking, and electronics/PCB design, to microcontroller programming and 3D printing. These skills aren’t just hobbies — they’re tools I actively bring into both personal and professional projects.

Feel free to explore my [projects,](/projects/) and get a glimpse into the work that excites me. From school and work-related projects to personal creations, this site is a reflection of my journey as an engineer, maker, and lifelong learner.
