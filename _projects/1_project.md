This project was developed upon request for use in the MEA course as an educational tool. It is designed using a combination of 3D printing and laser cutting for rapid prototyping and manufacturing. The system is powered by an Arduino Nano, with a custom PCB simplifying the electronic circuit.
Key components include:

- HX711 (amplifier)
- Load cell
- OLED display
- Arduino Nano

The software is accessible via LabVIEW or any IDE that supports USB communication. Additionally, the OLED display serves as a standalone visualization tool, enabling operation without a computer â€” only a power supply is required.

And the only thinge left to do now was to test it
