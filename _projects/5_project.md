<h3>Introduction</h3>
This was a fun project involving the structural design of a greenhouse. Greenhouses can be very expensive if bought off the shelf—especially at this size. My father needed a large space, as a giant pumpkin takes up quite a lot of room. The greenhouse is approximately 80 m² and is built using wooden frames and special shielding material to maintain the right climate inside.

After completing the design process in SolidWorks, we built everything by hand—and the result speaks for itself. Just take a look at how the pumpkin thrived inside its cozy new home.
