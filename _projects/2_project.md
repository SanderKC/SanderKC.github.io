<h3>Introduction</h3>
This robot is an autonomus sorting system intended for insects samples from greenland. The project was started in the summer of 2023 as a bachelor's project and the foundation for my employment at Aarhus Univerty, where i continued to develop and improve abon the design. The device is an extention to the SRS (specimen Requsition system)

<h3>Mechanics</h3>
The ISS prototype is a fully automated sorting system featuring 30 containers, designed for seamless compatibility with the SRS. Mechanical integration is achieved through a built-in drawer, which serves both as a platform for all essential ISS components and as an ergonomic solution for lab techniciansâ€”making container replacement more efficient and user-friendly.

Key components include:

- A rotating carousel for container organization
- A pneumatically controlled linear actuator
- Extensions for the SRS flushing system
- The mechanical structure of the drawer and a hinged access door
